00:06:08	vsuttor:	Verity and Don Colantonio from ISC
00:06:16	vsuttor:	Having issues with my microphone
00:09:32	Kenny Sabir:	Also Dose can also use the Measurement object since its date has been removed.
00:11:31	vsuttor:	Don't think it matters
00:20:19	vsuttor:	Does this include vaccinations 
00:24:07	vsuttor:	AVPMA government regulations for registration drugs
00:25:47	PeterR:	- agree
00:28:40	Vernon van Duijnhoven:	Why have multiple "responsible" persons?
00:30:30	Vernon van Duijnhoven:	Multiple levels seems a little redundant and confusing.
00:34:10	Kenny Sabir:	If the course is a plan, why is the treatment not used? The program still says EITHER OR, but in the course of a plan then the treatments are still used.
00:34:42	vsuttor:	Do we need the intended course?
00:36:31	vsuttor:	Why not have an extra attribute for vaccincation treatment as it not really a medicine
00:38:20	vsuttor:	That is true. Most of our farmers categories vaccination as different to medicine
00:41:11	vsuttor:	Our producers work on markets - domestic verse EU
00:41:38	vsuttor:	Agree
00:46:29	vsuttor:	Yes
00:46:59	vsuttor:	You need to be specific
00:47:23	Vernon van Duijnhoven:	Agree. Specific is best.
00:48:45	Vernon van Duijnhoven:	Ok, makes sense.
00:49:12	vsuttor:	Missed exposure
00:49:29	vsuttor:	Example toxic plants
00:49:35	vsuttor:	lead
00:49:45	vsuttor:	animal fat products
00:49:51	vsuttor:	cotton trash
00:50:04	vsuttor:	YEs it sdifferent
00:50:22	vsuttor:	No cant do that
00:50:39	vsuttor:	Sure - possible exposure is good
00:50:56	vsuttor:	It will also align to the health treatment declaration
00:51:53	vsuttor:	Sure - we would like treatment method
00:52:42	vsuttor:	Its too confusing for producers. However might work for the backend
00:55:42	vsuttor:	Thank you very much for everyones contribution today. We really apprecaite
00:55:47	PeterR:	Thanks A
